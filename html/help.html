                    <main><h1>What is JOIN?</h1>
  
        <div>JOIN is a simple Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool. Registered users will have a shared contact list and a shared Kanban board that includes all created tasks assigned to specific contacts.</div>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>This is JOIN's entry screen. You will find anything related to the tasks on the Kanban board at a glance. In the middle section you will get urgent tasks with its first upcoming deadline displayed.</p>

        <h3>Board</h3>
        <p>The Kanban board is a tool for workflow visualization, designed to help you bring clarity to your work process and enhance efficiency by limiting work in progress. With this new level of transparency, you will quickly identify problematic work stages, and by improving those, your team will soon work more efficiently.</p>
        <p>On the board you will find all created tasks separated into four sections. They are flagged as "To Do", "In progress", "Awaiting feedback" and "Done". To change the task state you can drag and drop a task card to another section. You can filter the tasks displayed on the board by searching for its specific task title or its description in the search field on top.</p>
